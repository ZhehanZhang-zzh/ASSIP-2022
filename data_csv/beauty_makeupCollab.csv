I am an Australian Makeup Artist and Beauty Blogger. Here on my channel you will learn tips and tricks on how to apply makeup, beauty & skincare product recommendations and ways to save money on makeup! I also upload easy step by step makeup tutorials that will teach you how to master any makeup look, from a dramatic smokey eye to a soft sun kissed glow! I share tidbits and recommendations that I have learned over the years working as a professional makeup artist in Australia - I am also a qualified Paramedic/Nurse and continue to work in these roles outside of makeup (I lead the ultimate double life!!) - I've got your back when it comes to long wearing makeup for shift workers!

Hi Friends happy Saturday!
Hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there. 
Today I wanted to sit down and cry apparently lol. I really hope you guys do know how much I appreciate you and the support you guys have constantly shown me. 
I know this palette may seem very random and I understand for sure. A year ago when I was asked to do this, my channel was just starting to really grow because of my MMM videos and I couldn’t have even imagined it would turn into what it is today! Seriously. It's mind-blowing. The palette is for IPSY Glam Bag Plus so I needed to take into consideration who the IPSY subscriber is and I tried to create something that hopefully everyone would like, even if they had no idea who I was or watched my videos. If any of that makes sense. Wow my grammar is horrid. If you're reading this hi. Hopefully, that answers any questions/confusion. It was a very cool experience to see how collaborating on a palette works and I am forever grateful for the opportunity. 
I hope you have a great weekend ahead and hey, if you need to cry it out, LET YOURSELF CRY IT OUT OKAY?  Its been one helluva year 2020, that’s for sure. 
Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day ahead!! I’ll be seeing you next week x o
