Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction is a multiplayer tactical shooter developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. A spin-off of Rainbow Six Siege (2015), Extraction is a cooperative multiplayer game in which players must work together to combat and defeat a type of parasite-like aliens called the Archaeans. The game is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S on January 20, 2022.

Rainbow Six Extraction is a cooperative multiplayer game that can support up to three players. In Extraction, the operators must infiltrate an alien-infested location and complete objectives, such as collecting samples, extracting materials from computers, and gathering intel. Each play session, known as an ""incursion"", is made up of three interconnected sub-maps, and players will be assigned any one of the twelve objectives randomly in each sub-map. The location of the objectives and the placement of enemies are procedurally generated. Once the player secured their objective, they can choose to extract themselves, or explore the next sub-map. New area would be more difficult than the previous one, but players would receive more rewards by completing them successfully. Extracting early ensures that all the operators would be safe. If an operator is taken down by enemy, they will become missing in action, and players cannot play as them until they have rescued them in an extraction mission.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbnMAo-HSDE/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbnMAo-HSDE/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbnMAo-HSDE/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbnMAo-HSDE/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbnMAo-HSDE/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,theRadBrad,20,none,RAINBOW SIX EXTRACTION PS5 Walkthrough Gameplay Part 1 - INTRO (PlayStation 5),"Buy Dying Light 2: Stay Human: https://wehy.pe/y/2/theRadBrad

Sens is also packing a new weapon – the high-capacity POF-9 Assault Rifle – which you can test out on the new shooting range and get a feel for it before jumping into the new Team Deathmatch map called Close Quarter. But that’s not all: Operation Vector Glare is unlocking a third secondary weapon option for some Operators and giving you a way to earn free Operators just by playing with your friend 

Operation Vector Glare hits the Test Server on PC on May 24, with the full season launch slated for June 7. You can play Sens at launch with the premium track of the Vector Glare Battle Pass, or unlock them two weeks after launch with Renown or R6 Credits.

Jason ‘Beaulo’ Doty joined TSM in June 2019 as a part of the organization’s first Rainbow Six Siege team. He is the team’s flex player, playing a wide variety of operators to fit whatever is needed for the map. Over the past few years, Beaulo became well known by many as a content creator, featuring his precise aim and overaggressive play on stream and YouTube while he could not officially compete due to age restrictions. His entry into the pro scene has come with a fair amount of hype, with many of his fans hoping to see him succeed in the Rainbow Six League.

About Rainbow Six Siege:

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is the upcoming installment of the acclaimed first-person shooter franchise developed by the renowned Ubisoft Montreal studio for the new generation of consoles and PC.

Breach enemy strongholds with new tactical measures or fortify your territory with defensive resources during sieges, a brand-new mode of assault combat for the Rainbow Six series.

- PROCEDURAL DESTRUCTION
Change the landscape of your assault with an unprecedented level of environmental destruction. Walls can be shattered, and floors and ceilings can be breached. Mastering the element of destruction is the key to victory.
