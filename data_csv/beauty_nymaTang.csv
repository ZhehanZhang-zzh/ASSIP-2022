I was walking through Sephora the other day and decided to see if I could find some bronzers for dark skin. Long story short I ended up spending over $800 on bronzers. Did any of them work? 

Do any of you have trouble finding bronzers?

I am finally doing this review on the KKW Contour and Highlight Kit in the ""Deep Dark Kit.""

I hope you guys enjoyed this video, if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up. 😘
