            "description": "You might know him as Kim Kardashian's loyal makeup artist. Maybe you know him as @MakeupByMario on Instagram. Or maybe you know Mario Dedivanovic as the man behind our modern obsession with highlighting and contouring. Arguably one of the biggest and most influential makeup artists of all time, Dedivanovic has spent decades delicately painting the faces of celebrities and then turning around and teaching all of us how to recreate the look through tutorials and his global Masterclass series. So you can imagine that his personal makeup collection is...large. Very, very large.\n\nIn this episode of #TheBeautyShow, Dedivanovic let BAZAAR visit his New York City home to get a tour of his beauty stash\u2014including his makeup closet, cologne collection, Yeezy shoe wall, and medicine cabinet. But his stash of products is so big that it actually starts in a storage room, where thousands of items are sent to him every month from beauty brands all over the globe. It's there that they're sorted and organized by his assistants, and only the essential products for his kit come home with him. \n\nYou can shop all of Mario's go-to products here: \nhttps://bit.ly/2D5Zxcj\n\nSubscribe to Harper's Bazaar: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoBAZAAR\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar\nhttps://twitter.com/harpersbazaarus\nhttps://www.instagram.com/harpersbazaarus/\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/harpersbazaar/?auto_follow=1\n\n\n#makeupbymario #beautystash #kimkardashian",

            "description": "In this video, I'm trying out the new Makeup by Mario Softsculpt Transforming Skin Enhancer and the Makeup by Mario Softsculpt Transforming Skin Perfector. These two products were launched at the end of May 2022 and were marketed to be used together. \n\nI've been a big fan of Makeup by Marios complexion products \u2014\u00a0especially the contour stick! I love how he maps out how each product is supposed to wear on the skin. And I feel like the makeup by mario softsculpt line really allows you to build onto each product with each new release.\n\nSo in this video, I'll be showing you both the skin enhancer and skin perfector on my medium to tan skin tone. Currently, I do have combination skin so I love a radiant finish that will continue to glow but not look greasy throughout the day!\n\nUPDATE:\nI wore this face of makeup for another 10 hours after filming this video. My face did get more oily through my t-zone, but the enhancer and perfector stayed put. I added more of the perfector to see how bronzed I could get my skin, and I looked like I just got back from vacation!! (Except I kind of did LOL). I love how I can build these products up but I still look like I have a super thin layer of product on my face. I liked it even more the longer I wore it on my skin because my natural oils blended so well with it. \n\nPRODUCTS MENTIONED:\nMakeup by Mario Softsculpt Skin Enhancer in shade medium: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1ilu6/\nMakeup by Mario Softsculpt Skin Perfector in shade medium dark: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1ilu8/\nClinique All About Eyes Rich: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1iluf/ \nClinique Moisture Surge 100h Hydrator: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1iluh/ \nClinique Almost Lipstick in shade Black Honey: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1ilui/ \nHourglass Mineral Viel Setting Powder: https://go.magik.ly/ml/1iluj/\n\nFOLLOW ME:\nMy photography IG: https://www.instagram.com/bykristinastudio\nMy influencer IG: https://www.instagram.com/k_aranilla/\nTIKTOK: @ bykristinastudio\n\n\n\nThe above description includes some affiliate links. #clinique gifted me products, but they do not sway my opinions and reviews.
