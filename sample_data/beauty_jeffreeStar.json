Similar to my iconic Pink Vault in my previous pink Calabasas home, but way bigger, this is truly a special closet. I didn't know if my house was going to sell or not before the closet was actually done being built.. I've had so many requests to see inside so... come along for a little journey. In today's episode, we also move the dogs permanently to my Wyoming ranch and they say goodbye to LA. \n\n*SHOP: http://www.jeffreestarcosmetics.com \n+ FOLLOW MY BRAND ON Instagram: http://instagram.com/jeffreestarcosmetics \n+FOLLOW ME ON IG: http://instagram.com/jeffreestar \n+ SNAPCHAT: jeffreestar \n+ TWITTER: @jeffreestar\n\nWATCH MORE VIDEOS...................\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udc89 FINDING OUR MAKEUP AT A CLEARANCE STORE \u25b7 https://bit.ly/3bDmulT\n\n\ud83d\udc9c ADDRESSING MY MENTAL HELP and SELLING MY HOUSE! \u25b7 https://bit.ly/3GCkJmU\n\n\ud83d\udd2e WATCH FULL FACE OF BRANDS THAT HATE ME  \u25ba https://bit.ly/2O6GgJi\n\nTrack: Diamond Eyes - Flutter [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nWatch: https://youtu.be/lEHM9HZf0IA\nFree Download / Stream: http://ncs.io/FlutterYO\n\nTrack: JJD - A New Adventure (feat.

I was ready to expand and felt in my heart we needed one more Pomeranian to add to our home. Welcome number 8, little Drizzle Lynn Star!!! He was born Nov. 3rd 2021 and he's my 3rd Scorpio dog! He's definitely the life of the party here at the Star YaK Ranch and is fitting in perfect! Come meet him and also get some major life updates about me! I've secretly had Drizzle for a few months so after you meet him, you'll see me jet-set off to beautiful Paris, France were I went to attend Virgil's last Louis Vuitton runway show.
